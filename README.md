I'm a Javascript Architect/Lead with over a decade of experience and you've stumbled upon my personal slice of the Github – a place where I push the fruits of my curiousity, things I learn and am passionate about, as well as the outcome of the work I do and can share publicly.


Here are some ideas to get you started:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Enterprise Projects with Angular since last few years
- 📝 I write stuff at [aalam.in](https://aalam.in)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/exploring Rust, Golang besides all the latest and great things happening in the Front-end/Javascript ecosystem.
- 💬 Ask me about all things modern JS - Type-safety, Frameworks/Libraries, Meta-frameworks/SSGs, Server-side Runtimes, Tooling + DBs/DBs-as-service/cloud/Querying layers, GraphQL, etc.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
