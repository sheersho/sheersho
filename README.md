I'm Sheersho. I work as a full-time software engineer. In my spare time I do open-sourcing _(normally it is about 1-2 hours in the morning before the work)_. Most of my open-source projects below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing -  **to help people learn** 📚. You may use these projects to learn about _algorithms in JavaScript_ and get prepared for _technical interviews_, or to learn _Python_ syntax and start experimenting with _machine learning algorithms_ and math behind them, etc. I also write [articles](https://dev.to/sheersho) about life, web-development and machine learning.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Enterprise Projects with React since the last year.
- 📝 I write stuff at [sheersho.github.io](https://sheersho.github.io)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/exploring Rust, Golang besides all the latest and great things happening in the Front-end/Javascript ecosystem.
- 💬 Ask me about all things modern JS - Type-safety, Frameworks/Libraries, Meta-frameworks/SSGs, Server-side Runtimes, Tooling + DBs/DBs-as-service/cloud/Querying layers, GraphQL, etc.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
